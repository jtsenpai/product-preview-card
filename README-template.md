## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use semantics as it was on the few issues I had in my previous project. I have gotten used to CSS Grid and having a responsive design.

### Continued development

I need to learn more on CSS Grid and focused on flexbox.
